# Progress for Adaptive Learning System

## What Works

- **Resource Ingestion and Indexing**: All resource types (text, PDF, video, image) are successfully ingested and
  indexed for retrieval. Video transcription is fully operational using the 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' model for
  Brazilian Portuguese content.
- **Adaptive Prompt Engine**: The prompt engine is fully functional, enhanced with spaCy for NLP-based knowledge gap
  assessment and improved content retrieval mechanisms, ensuring relevant responses to user queries.
- **Content Generation**: Basic content adaptation is in place, generating dynamic content based on user input and
  indexed data. Content is delivered in user-preferred formats (text, video, audio).
- **User Interface**: The web UI is fully implemented using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend,
  integrated with the Prompt Engine for dynamic content delivery. It is operational on both localhost and Docker
  environments, featuring session persistence via localStorage and server-side storage, user preference selection for
  content format, and an enhanced feedback mechanism with multi-dimensional ratings (general, relevance, effectiveness).
- **Integration and Testing**: Integration tests for API endpoints (message and feedback) are updated in
  `test_integration.py`, with all tests passing, validating core functionality, user interaction, UI responsiveness, and
  content adaptation accuracy.

## What's Left to Build

- **Advanced Content Generation**: Integration of advanced NLP frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex for more nuanced
  content generation and contextual memory in longer conversations is pending. This will enhance the depth and
  personalization of learning content.
- **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing**: Additional testing for UI responsiveness and content adaptation accuracy across
  diverse user scenarios and edge cases (e.g., unavailable content, general queries) is needed to ensure system
  reliability under varied conditions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimization for handling large datasets and concurrent users with efficient indexing
  solutions (e.g., Elasticsearch, Pinecone) to improve scalability and response times.
- **Repository Management and Delivery**: Final steps for forking the repository, pushing code to GitHub, and notifying
  the recruiter as per project instructions remain to be completed, marking the final submission phase.

## Current Status

The adaptive learning system is in an advanced stage of development with core functionalities operational. Recent
enhancements include server-side persistence for user preferences, detailed feedback mechanisms for deeper user
insights, and successful integration testing. The system meets privacy requirements with local data processing and
adheres to high code quality and modular design standards. Documentation updates are in progress to finalize project
records before delivery.

## Known Issues

- **Content Generation Depth**: Current content generation lacks advanced contextual understanding for complex user
  queries. This will be addressed with potential integrations of advanced NLP frameworks.
- **Testing Coverage**: While core API endpoints are tested, broader end-to-end testing for diverse user scenarios and
  UI interactions is incomplete, which may reveal unaddressed edge cases.
- **Scalability**: Performance with large datasets or high user concurrency has not been fully tested or optimized,
  which could impact response times in production environments.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Focus**: Early development prioritized data ingestion and indexing across multiple resource types,
  establishing a robust foundation for content retrieval.
- **Prompt Engine Enhancement**: The prompt engine was enhanced with spaCy for semantic analysis, improving knowledge
  gap identification and user interaction quality.
- **UI Development**: Shifted focus to a fully integrated web UI with FastAPI and React, providing a conversational
  interface with session persistence and user preference features for a personalized experience.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Expanded the feedback system to capture multi-dimensional user ratings (general, relevance,
  effectiveness), enabling detailed insights for continuous system improvement.
- **Testing Strategy**: Adjusted testing approach to mitigate cache interference by using unique identifiers in test
  inputs, ensuring accurate validation of system responses.
- **Documentation and Delivery**: Current focus is on finalizing comprehensive documentation across memory bank files
  and project documents (`PRD.md`, `COMMENTS.md`, `README.md`) to meet delivery criteria and ensure traceability to
  project goals.
