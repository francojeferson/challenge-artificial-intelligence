# Progress

## What Works

- Project requirements and resources reviewed
- Memory Bank structure and documentation initialized
- Core project context, architecture, and technology stack documented

## What's Left to Build

- Data ingestion and indexing modules for all resource types (text, PDF, video, image)
- Adaptive prompt engine for user knowledge assessment and content generation
- Integration of search, retrieval, and content generation components
- User interface for interactive, adaptive learning experience
- Documentation of architecture, libraries, and decisions in COMMENTS.md

## Current Status

- Project is in the planning and documentation phase
- Ready to begin technical implementation

## Known Issues

- None at this stage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial focus on modularity, extensibility, and local processing
- Emphasis on adaptive, user-centered experience and robust documentation
- Shifted primary technology stack to Python 3.8+ for better alignment with PRD

## Success Criteria

- All resource types are correctly ingested, indexed, and retrievable
- Adaptive prompt engine accurately identifies knowledge gaps and generates relevant content
- User interface is intuitive and adapts to user preferences
- All processing is local and privacy-respecting
- Codebase is modular, extensible, and well-documented
- All deliverables (including documentation) are complete and meet project requirements

## Risks & Mitigations

- Complexity of resource extraction: Use proven libraries and modular adapters
- Performance with large datasets: Employ efficient indexing/search solutions
- User adaptation accuracy: Iteratively test and refine prompt logic
- Documentation gaps: Enforce documentation as part of the development workflow
