# Progress for Adaptive Learning System

## What Works

- Resource ingestion and indexing across all types: text, PDF, image, and video, with successful processing confirmed in
  recent runs.
- Video transcription operational with the 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' model for Brazilian Portuguese content, verified in
  both local and Docker environments, loading the model from './vosk-model-small-pt-0.3'.
- Error handling for text processing to skip NLTK operations if required data is missing, ensuring ingestion continuity.
- Audio conversion fallbacks in video ingestion using 'moviepy' when 'ffmpeg' is not directly available, maintaining
  functionality.
- Metadata extraction and storage even when content extraction fails, ensuring all resources are accounted for in the
  index.
- Updated Docker configuration to support containerized deployment, with resolved dependency issues for building the
  image, including copying the Vosk model and downloading NLTK data during the build process.
- Successful Docker image build and container run, confirming the application operates as expected in a containerized
  environment with all necessary resources available.
- Adaptive Prompt Engine (Milestone 3) enhanced with spaCy for NLP-based knowledge gap assessment, enabling more
  accurate topic classification and personalized content delivery via 'prompt_engine.py'.
- Improved content retrieval in `PromptEngine` with an expanded fallback mechanism to provide meaningful responses for
  general queries and specific topics.
- Localized user interaction to Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR), with prompts, responses, and interface text updated for a
  consistent language experience.
- Implemented a retry mechanism for temporary file deletion in 'video_ingestor.py', reducing the risk of disk space
  issues by attempting deletion multiple times before logging a warning.
- Confirmed the installation of the spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm', ensuring readiness for enhanced text processing
  without additional setup.
- Developed a web-based user interface using FastAPI and React, providing a conversational chat interface for adaptive
  learning, now integrated with `PromptEngine` for dynamic content delivery via 'web_app.py' with improved logging and
  error handling.
- Integrated the React frontend build process into the Dockerfile, ensuring the web UI is built and served correctly in
  both local and containerized environments.
- Added comprehensive integration tests in 'test_integration.py' for the API endpoint, covering user interaction,
  content delivery, fallback scenarios for general queries, and updated error handling messages.
- Updated `run.py` to support both CLI and web UI interaction modes, with an option to start the FastAPI server,
  improved error handling, and consistent logging configuration.
- Updated project documentation, including `COMMENTS.md` and Memory Bank files, with detailed architecture decisions,
  library usage, setup instructions, and project status for both local and Docker environments.

## What's Left to Build

- Refine the web UI for improved usability, adding features like session persistence and user preference selection for
  content format (text, video, audio) to fully complete Milestone 5.
- Conduct further end-to-end testing to validate UI responsiveness and content adaptation accuracy across diverse user
  scenarios, completing Milestone 6.
- Gather user feedback on the system's effectiveness in identifying knowledge gaps and delivering relevant content to
  inform further iterations.
- Explore advanced NLP integration (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex) for more nuanced content generation as a potential
  enhancement.
- Finalize repository management and delivery steps (Milestone 8) as per project instructions, including forking,
  pushing code, and notifying the recruiter.

## Current Status

- The system is fully operational for ingesting and indexing resources of all supported types, both locally and in a
  Docker container.
- Video transcription is active with the lightweight model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' for Brazilian Portuguese content.
- Adaptive Prompt Engine is significantly improved with NLP capabilities for better knowledge gap assessment and content
  retrieval.
- Web UI is implemented and integrated with `PromptEngine` for dynamic user interaction via FastAPI backend and React
  frontend, with enhanced error handling and logging.
- Integration tests are updated in `test_integration.py` to cover general query fallback responses and current error
  messages, validating API functionality.
- `run.py` now supports both CLI and web UI modes, allowing users to start the FastAPI server for web interaction.
- Documentation is updated in `COMMENTS.md` and Memory Bank files to reflect the current state and technical decisions.

## Known Issues

- Temporary file deletion warnings during video ingestion due to file access conflicts are mitigated but may still
  appear.
- Alternative Vosk model fails to load due to CARPA file issues; current model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' is used.
- Some npm package deprecation warnings during frontend build; no critical impact on functionality.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Prioritized local, privacy-respecting processing with open-source tools to align with non-functional requirements.
- Shifted from CLI to web-based UI for better user experience, now fully integrated with backend logic for adaptive
  content.
- Integrated frontend build into Docker for consistent deployment across environments.
- Adopted modular design and clear separation of concerns to support extensibility.
- Emphasized detailed documentation and iterative development, with recent updates to Memory Bank and `COMMENTS.md` for
  traceability.
- Focused on NLP enhancements with spaCy to improve knowledge gap classification over basic keyword matching.
