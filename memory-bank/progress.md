# Progress

## What Works

- Project requirements and resources reviewed
- Memory Bank structure and documentation initialized
- Core project context, architecture, and technology stack documented
- Planning and documentation phase completed
- Data ingestion modules for text, PDF, video, and image resources updated with enhanced content extraction and metadata
  handling
- Initial implementation of indexing functionality with index_manager.py
- Updated run.py to integrate ingestion modules and build an index for search functionality, now also ingesting
  resources directly from the `resources/` directory if subdirectories are empty
- Refined requirements.txt with dependencies for data processing, text, PDF, video, and image handling, replacing
  `whisper` with `vosk`
- Successfully resolved dependency issues and import errors, allowing `run.py` to execute without errors
- Created `ResourceIngestor` class to manage ingestion of various resource types

## What's Left to Build

- Completion of indexing module for efficient resource retrieval using index_manager.py
- Verification that resources are now being ingested correctly with the updated `run.py`
- Adaptive prompt engine for user knowledge assessment and content generation
- Integration of search, retrieval, and content generation components
- User interface for interactive, adaptive learning experience
- Final documentation of architecture, libraries, and decisions in COMMENTS.md

## Current Status

- Project is in the technical implementation phase
- Significant progress on data ingestion and indexing modules for all resource types, with `run.py` now executing
  successfully
- Ingestion process reports 0 resources ingested, which needs further investigation

## Known Issues

- None at this stage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial focus on modularity, extensibility, and local processing
- Emphasis on adaptive, user-centered experience and robust documentation
- Shifted primary technology stack to Python 3.8+ for better alignment with PRD
- Transitioned from planning to implementation phase with updated Memory Bank documentation
- Enhanced ingestion modules to improve content extraction (e.g., OCR for scanned PDFs, better metadata extraction for
  images and videos)
- Added indexing capabilities to support efficient search and retrieval as a foundation for adaptive learning
- Adapted video ingestion to use `vosk` instead of `whisper` due to dependency issues, with instructions for model setup
- Created `ResourceIngestor` to manage ingestion processes, resolving import errors
- Updated `run.py` to handle resources directly in the `resources/` directory to address ingestion issues

## Success Criteria

- All resource types are correctly ingested, indexed, and retrievable
- Adaptive prompt engine accurately identifies knowledge gaps and generates relevant content
- User interface is intuitive and adapts to user preferences
- All processing is local and privacy-respecting
- Codebase is modular, extensible, and well-documented
- All deliverables (including documentation) are complete and meet project requirements

## Risks & Mitigations

- Complexity of resource extraction: Use proven libraries and modular adapters
- Performance with large datasets: Employ efficient indexing/search solutions
- User adaptation accuracy: Iteratively test and refine prompt logic
- Documentation gaps: Enforce documentation as part of the development workflow
