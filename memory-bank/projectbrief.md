# Project Brief

## Project

+A Educação - Engenheiro de Inteligência Artificial Challenge

## Goal

Develop an adaptive learning system that indexes and dynamically generates content based on user knowledge gaps, using a
provided dataset (texts, PDFs, videos, images). All data processing must be local (no external data sharing), and the
system must be modular, extensible, and well-documented.

- The system must provide continuous feedback and adapt content dynamically based on user progress and preferences.
- Success criteria must be clearly defined and met for all deliverables.

## Deliverables

- Indexed data for all resource types (text, PDF, video, image)
- Adaptive prompt system for personalized learning
- Well-organized, high-quality, modular, and extensible codebase
- Documentation (including COMMENTS.md with architecture, libraries, improvements, and unmet requirements)
- Repository management as per instructions (fork, push, notify, privatize after review)
- All processing is local and privacy-respecting

## Source Data

- Texts: Learning module content
- PDFs: Books and manuals
- Videos: Short instructional videos
- Images: Infographics and visual content

## User Stories

- As a learner, I want to interact with a conversational interface that identifies my knowledge gaps, so I can focus on
  what I need to learn.
- As a learner, I want to receive content in my preferred format (text, video, audio), so my learning experience matches
  my style.
- As a learner, I want the system to adapt to my progress and feedback, so the content remains relevant and effective.
- As a developer, I want the system to be modular and extensible, so new resource types and learning strategies can be
  added easily.
- As a reviewer, I want clear documentation of architecture, libraries, and decisions, so I can evaluate the system’s
  quality and maintainability.
