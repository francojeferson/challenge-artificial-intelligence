# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The challenge addresses the need for adaptive, personalized learning in programming fundamentals. Traditional static
content does not efficiently identify or address individual knowledge gaps.

## Problems It Solves

- Difficulty in assessing and remediating user knowledge gaps in foundational programming topics.
- Inefficient search and retrieval of relevant educational resources across multiple formats (text, PDF, video, image).
- Lack of dynamic, user-tailored content generation in current educational platforms.

## How It Should Work

- Index all provided educational resources for efficient, relevant search and retrieval.
- Use an interactive prompt to identify user difficulties and knowledge gaps through dialogue.
- Generate short, dynamic content in the user's preferred format (text, video, audio) to address specific learning
  needs.
- Adapt to user preferences for content format and learning style.

## User Experience Goals

- Intuitive, conversational interface for knowledge assessment.
- Seamless adaptation to user learning preferences (text, video, audio).
- Delivery of concise, relevant, and level-appropriate content.
- Continuous feedback and adaptation based on user interactions.
