# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Project initialization and requirements analysis
- Memory Bank structure and documentation setup
- Review of README.md and resources/ content

## Recent Changes

- Created Memory Bank core files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
- Documented project goals, context, architecture, and technology stack

## Next Steps

1. Select and configure indexing tools for each data type (text, PDF, video, image)
2. Prototype adaptive prompt logic for user knowledge assessment and content generation
3. Document architecture and technology decisions in COMMENTS.md
4. Begin implementation of data ingestion and indexing modules

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize modular, extensible architecture
- Ensure all processing is local and privacy-respecting
- Focus on efficient, relevant search and adaptive content delivery

## Learnings & Project Insights

- The challenge requires robust handling of diverse educational resources
- User experience must be adaptive, intuitive, and format-flexible
- Documentation and code quality are key evaluation criteria
