# Active Context for Adaptive Learning System

## Current Work Focus

- Successfully integrated the Vosk model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' for Brazilian Portuguese video transcription after an
  unsuccessful attempt with an alternative model.
- Updated 'video_ingestor.py' to use the model located at './vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' by default, with an environment
  variable override option 'VOSK_MODEL_PATH'.
- Ran 'run.py' to confirm that the model is loaded and used for video ingestion, resulting in successful processing of
  all resource types.

## Recent Changes

- Modified ingestion scripts to handle errors gracefully and ensure metadata is returned even if content extraction
  fails.
- Enhanced error handling for text processing to skip NLTK operations if required data is missing.
- Implemented audio conversion fallbacks in video ingestion using 'moviepy' when 'ffmpeg' is unavailable.
- Updated Vosk model recommendations and paths in 'video_ingestor.py' to support Brazilian Portuguese content, initially
  attempting to use 'vosk-model-pt-fb-v0.1.1-20220516_2113' for higher accuracy, but reverted to
  'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' due to model loading errors with the alternative.

## Next Steps

- Monitor the system for any remaining issues with temporary file deletion warnings during video processing.
- Investigate potential causes for the failure of the alternative model 'vosk-model-pt-fb-v0.1.1-20220516_2113' and
  explore other models or configurations if transcription accuracy needs improvement.
- Test Docker image build and deployment to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the application runs as
  expected in a containerized environment.
- Update other memory bank files as needed to reflect any new technical decisions or patterns identified.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decided to revert to 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' as the default due to its successful operation, after the alternative
  model 'vosk-model-pt-fb-v0.1.1-20220516_2113' failed to load with an error related to the CARPA model file.
- Considered the impact of temporary file access issues but deemed them non-critical to core functionality.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Preference for local processing to ensure privacy, as seen in the use of Vosk for offline transcription.
- Pattern of iterative updates to handle user feedback on language-specific requirements, ensuring the system adapts to
  specific content needs.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Learned that Vosk model paths must be explicitly set and validated, as model availability and compatibility are
  critical for video transcription.
- Insight that not all Vosk models may load correctly due to internal file structure issues, necessitating fallback
  options and thorough testing before deployment.
- Understood that user feedback on language requirements can significantly impact tool selection and configuration,
  requiring flexibility in model recommendations.
