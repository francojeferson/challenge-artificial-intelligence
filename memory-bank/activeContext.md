# Active Context for Adaptive Learning System

## Current Work Focus

- Successfully built and tested a Docker image for the Adaptive Learning System, ensuring all necessary resources (Vosk
  model and NLTK data) are included and operational within the containerized environment.
- Completed investigation into the alternative Vosk model 'vosk-model-pt-fb-v0.1.1-20220516_2113', confirming it fails
  to load due to a CARPA model file error ("ConstArpaLm <LmStates> section reading failed").
- Updated error handling in 'video_ingestor.py' to address temporary file deletion warnings, though the issue persists
  and requires further resolution.
- Ran 'run.py' within a Docker container to confirm successful ingestion and indexing of all resource types, including
  video transcription with the default model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3'.

## Recent Changes

- Updated Dockerfile to include copying the Vosk model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' and downloading NLTK data ('punkt_tab'
  and 'averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng') to a user-accessible directory with proper permissions.
- Built and deployed a Docker image tagged 'adaptive-learning-system', which successfully ran the application without
  previous errors related to missing resources.
- Enhanced 'video_ingestor.py' to attempt loading the alternative Vosk model and log specific errors before falling back
  to the default model.
- Improved error handling for temporary file deletion in 'video_ingestor.py' to provide detailed warning messages when
  deletion fails due to access conflicts.

## Next Steps

- Explore advanced strategies for temporary file handling to fully resolve persistent deletion warnings, potentially
  using delayed deletion, retry mechanisms, or alternative file management libraries.
- Gather user feedback on transcription accuracy of the current model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3'. If accuracy is
  insufficient, consider sourcing a different Vosk model or version for Brazilian Portuguese content from the official
  repository.
- Address the warning about the missing spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' by updating the Dockerfile or requirements to
  include it, if deemed necessary for enhanced text processing.
- Update other memory bank files as needed to reflect any new technical decisions or patterns identified.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decided to stick with the Vosk model 'vosk-model-small-pt-0.3' as the default for video transcription due to the
  failure of the alternative model 'vosk-model-pt-fb-v0.1.1-20220516_2113'. Further model exploration will depend on
  user feedback regarding transcription accuracy.
- Considered the persistent temporary file access issues as a non-critical but important area for improvement to prevent
  potential disk space problems over time.
- Confirmed Docker deployment as a viable method for running the application with all dependencies isolated, noting the
  successful resolution of NLTK and Vosk model issues in the container.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Preference for local processing to ensure privacy, as seen in the use of Vosk for offline transcription.
- Pattern of iterative updates to handle user feedback on language-specific requirements, ensuring the system adapts to
  specific content needs.
- Emphasis on detailed error logging and fallback mechanisms to maintain system robustness during resource ingestion.
- Focus on containerization for reproducibility and dependency management, ensuring consistent application behavior
  across environments.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Learned that specific Vosk model errors, such as issues with CARPA file reading, may require model file updates or
  replacements from the source, which might not be feasible within the current project scope.
- Insight that temporary file deletion issues on Windows systems may require advanced handling strategies, such as retry
  mechanisms or alternative file management libraries, to prevent access conflicts.
- Understood that user feedback on transcription accuracy is critical for deciding whether to invest effort in sourcing
  or configuring alternative models.
- Recognized the importance of explicitly including all necessary resources (models, data) in Docker images to ensure
  functionality in isolated environments, along with proper permission settings for non-root users.
