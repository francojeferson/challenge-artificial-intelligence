# Active Context for Adaptive Learning System

## Current Work Focus

- Developed and integrated the Adaptive Prompt Engine Prototype (Milestone 3) into the system, enabling interactive user
  dialogue to assess knowledge gaps and deliver personalized content.
- Localized the prompt engine and user interface in 'run.py' to support Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) interaction,
  aligning with user requirements for language-specific engagement.
- Resolved syntax errors and formatting issues in 'prompt_engine.py' to ensure the codebase is functional and ready for
  testing.

## Recent Changes

- Created 'prompt_engine.py' in the 'adaptive_learning/prompt/' directory, implementing the `PromptEngine` class for
  user knowledge assessment, dynamic prompt generation, and content adaptation based on user preferences.
- Integrated `PromptEngine` with `IndexManager` to retrieve content from indexed resources using semantic and keyword
  search methods.
- Updated 'run.py' to include an interactive loop for user engagement, allowing input of learning needs and receiving
  tailored responses.
- Localized all user-facing text in 'prompt_engine.py' and 'run.py' to Brazilian Portuguese, including prompts,
  responses, and interface messages, to meet the user's request for PT-BR interaction.

## Next Steps

- Test the interactive session with the updated PT-BR interface to ensure functionality and user experience align with
  expectations.
- Gather user feedback on the prompt engine's effectiveness in identifying knowledge gaps and delivering relevant
  content, particularly in the context of Brazilian Portuguese content.
- Address any remaining minor issues, such as temporary file deletion warnings during video processing, and assess the
  need for the spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' for enhanced text processing.
- Proceed to Milestone 4 (Content Generation Module) to further develop dynamic content creation capabilities based on
  user feedback and project requirements.
- Update other Memory Bank files as needed to reflect ongoing progress and technical decisions.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decided to prioritize Brazilian Portuguese localization for user interaction to meet the user's specific request,
  ensuring cultural and linguistic relevance.
- Considered the current placeholder logic for knowledge assessment as sufficient for the prototype phase, with plans to
  enhance it with NLP techniques (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex) in future iterations if feedback indicates the need.
- Confirmed the integration of `PromptEngine` with `IndexManager` as a critical step for delivering personalized
  content, with flexibility to refine search algorithms based on performance.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Preference for language-specific user interaction (currently PT-BR) to enhance accessibility and user engagement, as
  seen in the localization of prompts and interface text.
- Pattern of modular development, with clear separation between ingestion, indexing, and prompt logic, ensuring
  extensibility for future enhancements.
- Emphasis on iterative feedback loops to refine system components, particularly for user interaction and content
  delivery.
- Focus on maintaining high code quality with PEP 8 standards, type hints, and detailed documentation to support
  maintainability and review.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Learned that localization requires not only translation of text but also adaptation of logic to detect
  language-specific keywords for accurate knowledge assessment.
- Insight that user feedback on language and interaction quality is essential for validating localization efforts and
  ensuring the system meets cultural expectations.
- Understood that syntax errors from tool misuse (e.g., stray markers) can be quickly resolved by careful review of file
  content and precise replacements.
- Recognized the importance of updating Memory Bank files to preserve project context, especially after significant
  milestones or user requests, to maintain continuity across sessions.
