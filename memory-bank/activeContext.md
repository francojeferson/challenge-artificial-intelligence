# Active Context for Adaptive Learning System

## Current Work Focus

- Developed and integrated the Adaptive Prompt Engine Prototype (Milestone 3) into the system, enabling interactive user
  dialogue to assess knowledge gaps and deliver personalized content.
- Localized the prompt engine and user interface in 'run.py' to support Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) interaction,
  aligning with user requirements for language-specific engagement.
- Resolved syntax errors and formatting issues in 'prompt_engine.py' to ensure the codebase is functional and ready for
  testing.
- Implemented a retry mechanism for temporary file deletion in 'video_ingestor.py' to address warnings during video
  processing, reducing the risk of disk space issues.
- Confirmed the installation of the spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' for enhanced text processing, resolving any previous
  warnings about its absence.

## Recent Changes

- Created 'prompt_engine.py' in the 'adaptive_learning/prompt/' directory, implementing the `PromptEngine` class for
  user knowledge assessment, dynamic prompt generation, and content adaptation based on user preferences.
- Integrated `PromptEngine` with `IndexManager` to retrieve content from indexed resources using semantic and keyword
  search methods.
- Updated 'run.py' to include an interactive loop for user engagement, allowing input of learning needs and receiving
  tailored responses.
- Localized all user-facing text in 'prompt_engine.py' and 'run.py' to Brazilian Portuguese, including prompts,
  responses, and interface messages, to meet the user's request for PT-BR interaction.
- Modified 'video_ingestor.py' to include a retry mechanism for deleting temporary files, addressing file access
  conflict warnings during video processing.
- Verified that the spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' is installed, ensuring no further action is needed for text processing
  enhancements.

## Next Steps

- Test the interactive session with the updated PT-BR interface to ensure functionality and user experience align with
  expectations.
- Gather user feedback on the prompt engine's effectiveness in identifying knowledge gaps and delivering relevant
  content, particularly in the context of Brazilian Portuguese content.
- Proceed to Milestone 4 (Content Generation Module) to further develop dynamic content creation capabilities based on
  user feedback and project requirements.
- Update other Memory Bank files as needed to reflect ongoing progress and technical decisions.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decided to prioritize Brazilian Portuguese localization for user interaction to meet the user's specific request,
  ensuring cultural and linguistic relevance.
- Considered the current placeholder logic for knowledge assessment as sufficient for the prototype phase, with plans to
  enhance it with NLP techniques (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex) in future iterations if feedback indicates the need.
- Confirmed the integration of `PromptEngine` with `IndexManager` as a critical step for delivering personalized
  content, with flexibility to refine search algorithms based on performance.
- Decided to implement a retry mechanism for temporary file deletion to mitigate file access issues, with ongoing
  monitoring to ensure effectiveness.
- Determined that no action is required for the spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' as it is already installed and available
  for use.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Preference for language-specific user interaction (currently PT-BR) to enhance accessibility and user engagement, as
  seen in the localization of prompts and interface text.
- Pattern of modular development, with clear separation between ingestion, indexing, and prompt logic, ensuring
  extensibility for future enhancements.
- Emphasis on iterative feedback loops to refine system components, particularly for user interaction and content
  delivery.
- Focus on maintaining high code quality with PEP 8 standards, type hints, and detailed documentation to support
  maintainability and review.
- Commitment to resolving minor technical issues promptly to maintain system stability and user experience.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Learned that localization requires not only translation of text but also adaptation of logic to detect
  language-specific keywords for accurate knowledge assessment.
- Insight that user feedback on language and interaction quality is essential for validating localization efforts and
  ensuring the system meets cultural expectations.
- Understood that syntax errors from tool misuse (e.g., stray markers) can be quickly resolved by careful review of file
  content and precise replacements.
- Recognized the importance of updating Memory Bank files to preserve project context, especially after significant
  milestones or user requests, to maintain continuity across sessions.
- Learned that implementing retry mechanisms for file operations can effectively mitigate temporary access conflicts,
  improving system robustness.
- Confirmed that verifying the presence of required models like spaCy can prevent unnecessary updates and ensure system
  readiness for advanced processing tasks.
