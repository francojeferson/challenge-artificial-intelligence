# Active Context for Adaptive Learning System

## Current Work Focus

- Enhanced the `PromptEngine` in `prompt_engine.py` to improve knowledge gap assessment by integrating spaCy for deeper
  NLP analysis, enabling more accurate topic classification based on semantic understanding of user input.
- Improved content retrieval mechanisms in `PromptEngine` with an expanded fallback system to ensure meaningful
  responses for both general queries and specific topics, enhancing user experience.
- Integrated the web-based UI in `web_app.py` with `PromptEngine`, allowing the FastAPI backend to dynamically process
  user messages and deliver personalized content through the API endpoint, with improved logging and error handling.
- Developed a testing strategy by updating `test_integration.py` with comprehensive test cases for API integration,
  covering basic responses, fallback scenarios for general queries, and updated error handling to validate end-to-end
  functionality.
- Updated `run.py` to support both CLI and web UI interaction modes, adding an option to start the FastAPI server and
  improving error handling for robustness.
- Updated project documentation, including `COMMENTS.md`, to reflect architecture decisions, third-party libraries,
  potential improvements, and unmet requirements, ensuring traceability to PRD success criteria.
- Maintained localization to Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) for user-facing interactions, aligning with user requirements
  for language-specific engagement.
- Ensured all processing remains local and privacy-respecting, adhering to project non-functional requirements.

## Recent Changes

- Updated `prompt_engine.py` to incorporate spaCy for NLP-based topic classification, expanded fallback mechanisms for
  content retrieval, and fixed minor typos in indicator lists.
- Modified `web_app.py` to integrate with `PromptEngine`, enabling dynamic content generation based on user input
  through the FastAPI API endpoint, with added logging configuration and user-friendly error messages in Brazilian
  Portuguese.
- Enhanced `test_integration.py` with new test cases for web app integration, including general query fallback
  responses, and updated error handling messages to match the current implementation.
- Updated `run.py` to include an option for starting the web UI server with FastAPI, improved error handling for
  ingestion and indexing, and added consistent logging configuration.
- Revised `COMMENTS.md` with detailed architecture decisions, updated library list, future improvements, and status of
  unmet requirements.
- Reviewed and updated Memory Bank files to capture the current project state, technical decisions, and next steps for
  continuity.
- Confirmed successful operation of the web UI in both Docker and localhost environments, with features like session
  persistence, user preference selection for content format, and feedback mechanisms integrated.
- Successfully built and deployed the Adaptive Learning System in a Docker container named
  'adaptive-learning-container', running in detached mode with port 8000 mapped to the host, ensuring accessibility on
  `localhost:8000`.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining the web UI based on user feedback to further improve usability and ensure robust session persistence
  and user preference selection for content format (text, video, audio).
- Conduct further end-to-end testing to validate UI responsiveness and content adaptation accuracy across different user
  scenarios.
- Gather user feedback on the system's effectiveness in identifying knowledge gaps and delivering relevant content to
  inform further iterations.
- Explore advanced NLP integration (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex) for more nuanced content generation and user
  interaction.
- Finalize repository management and delivery steps as per project instructions, including forking, pushing code, and
  notifying the recruiter.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Prioritized integration of `PromptEngine` with the web UI to deliver adaptive content dynamically, enhancing the
  conversational experience.
- Focused on NLP enhancements for better knowledge gap classification, recognizing the importance of semantic
  understanding for personalized learning.
- Ensured modular design and clear separation of concerns to support maintainability and future extensibility of the
  system.
- Maintained emphasis on local processing for privacy, ensuring no external data sharing occurs during content
  generation or user interaction.
- Committed to detailed documentation and iterative development to facilitate project review and continuous improvement.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Modular architecture with distinct ingestion, indexing, prompt engine, content generation, and UI components for clear
  responsibility boundaries.
- Use of NLP-enhanced topic classification and fallback content retrieval to improve relevance and user satisfaction.
- Localization to Brazilian Portuguese for all user-facing text and interaction to meet regional user needs.
- Emphasis on iterative development with continuous feedback loops to refine system capabilities based on user input.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Integrating spaCy for NLP analysis significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge gap assessment over simple keyword
  matching.
- Dynamic integration of FastAPI with `PromptEngine` enables a seamless conversational interface, critical for adaptive
  learning.
- Comprehensive testing of API endpoints is essential to validate integration and handle edge cases like content
  unavailability or processing errors.
- Detailed documentation in `COMMENTS.md` and Memory Bank files ensures project traceability and supports effective
  communication with reviewers.
- Expanded fallback mechanisms in content retrieval prevent user frustration by providing meaningful responses even when
  specific content is unavailable.
