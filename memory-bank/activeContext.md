# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Technical implementation of data ingestion and indexing modules for all resource types (text, PDF, video, image)
- Development of indexing functionality with the addition of index_manager.py
- Resolving dependency and import issues to ensure `run.py` executes successfully
- Aligning project development with PRD milestones:
  - Data ingestion & indexing modules (text, PDF, video, image) - Significant progress, with successful execution of
    ingestion scripts
  - Adaptive prompt engine prototype
  - Content generation module
  - User interface implementation
  - Integration & testing
  - Documentation finalization (including COMMENTS.md with architecture, libraries, improvements, unmet requirements)
  - Repository management & delivery
- Enforcing non-functional requirements: all processing is local and privacy-respecting, only open-source and compatible
  dependencies, modular and maintainable codebase, containerization for isolation
- Documentation enforcement as a workflow: up-to-date documentation, COMMENTS.md, and traceability to PRD success
  criteria

## Recent Changes

- Completed planning and documentation phase
- Updated Memory Bank to reflect readiness for technical implementation
- Reviewed all core Memory Bank files to ensure alignment with project goals
- Updated ingestion modules for text, PDF, video, and image resources with enhanced content extraction and metadata
  handling
- Added index_manager.py to support indexing functionality
- Updated requirements.txt with refined dependencies for data processing, text, PDF, video, and image handling,
  replacing `whisper` with `vosk` due to installation issues
- Enhanced run.py to integrate ingestion modules and build an index for search functionality
- Created `resource_ingestor.py` to define `ResourceIngestor` class for managing ingestion of various resource types
- Updated `video_ingestor.py` to use `vosk` for video transcription and provided instructions for Vosk model setup
- Resolved multiple `ModuleNotFoundError` and `ImportError` issues to ensure `run.py` executes successfully
- Updated `run.py` to ingest resources directly from the `resources/` directory if specific subdirectories are empty or
  do not exist

## Next Steps

1. Complete the indexing module implementation using index_manager.py for efficient resource retrieval
2. Investigate why no resources are being ingested (reported 0 for each type) and ensure resources are correctly placed
   in expected directories
3. Prototype adaptive prompt logic for user knowledge assessment and content generation
4. Implement content generation module
5. Develop user interface for interactive, adaptive learning
6. Integrate and test all modules
7. Finalize documentation (including up-to-date COMMENTS.md with architecture, libraries, design decisions,
   improvements, unmet requirements)
8. Repository management and delivery
9. Ensure all deliverables and milestones meet PRD success criteria and non-functional requirements

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritize modular, extensible architecture
- Ensure all processing is local and privacy-respecting
- Focus on efficient, relevant search and adaptive content delivery
- Use Python 3.8+ as the primary technology stack
- Employ containerization for isolation and reproducibility
- Use only open-source, compatible dependencies

## Milestones & Timeline Alignment

- Project Setup & Documentation (Complete)
- Data Ingestion & Indexing Modules (Text, PDF, Video, Image) - Significant Progress
- Adaptive Prompt Engine Prototype
- Content Generation Module
- User Interface Implementation
- Integration & Testing
- Documentation Finalization (including COMMENTS.md)
- Repository Management & Delivery

## Risks & Mitigations Alignment

- Complexity of resource extraction: Use proven libraries and modular adapters
- Performance with large datasets: Employ efficient indexing/search solutions
- User adaptation accuracy: Iteratively test and refine prompt logic
- Documentation gaps: Enforce documentation as part of the development workflow

## Non-Functional Requirements Emphasis

- All processing is local and privacy-respecting
- Codebase is modular, extensible, and maintainable
- Continuous feedback and adaptation are integral to the workflow

## Learnings & Project Insights

- The challenge requires robust handling of diverse educational resources
- User experience must be adaptive, intuitive, and format-flexible
- Documentation and code quality are key evaluation criteria, enforced as part of the workflow
- Key risks: complexity of resource extraction, performance with large datasets, user adaptation accuracy, documentation
  gaps
- Mitigations: use proven libraries and modular adapters, employ efficient indexing/search, iteratively test/refine
  prompt logic, enforce documentation as part of workflow
- PRD success criteria: all resource types are correctly ingested, indexed, and retrievable; adaptive prompt engine
  accurately identifies knowledge gaps and generates relevant content; user interface is intuitive and adapts to user
  preferences; all processing is local and privacy-respecting; codebase is modular, extensible, and well-documented; all
  deliverables (including documentation) are complete and meet project requirements
- Continuous feedback and adaptation is an active workflow and critical to project success
- Risk mitigation includes iterative testing and refinement of prompt logic and enforcement of documentation as a core
  workflow
