## Architecture Decisions

- Adopted a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns among ingestion, indexing, prompt engine, content
  generation, and UI components.
- Used design patterns such as Strategy and Factory in the Content Generation Module to support extensibility and
  maintainability.
- Prioritized local processing for all content generation and transcription tasks to ensure user privacy and data
  security.
- Integrated existing open-source libraries for text-to-speech (pyttsx3) and video processing (moviepy) to leverage
  proven tools and reduce development time.

## Third-Party Libraries Used

- pyttsx3: Local text-to-speech synthesis.
- moviepy: Video creation and editing.
- spaCy: Natural language processing.
- Vosk: Offline speech recognition for video transcription.
- PyPDF2, pdfminer.six: PDF parsing.
- nltk: Text processing.
- Pillow, exifread: Image metadata extraction.

## Improvements for Future Work

- Enhance the Content Generation Module with advanced natural language generation models for more nuanced and
  context-aware content.
- Implement a richer user interface beyond the command line, possibly a web or desktop app with conversational UI.
- Improve video content generation by incorporating dynamic slides or animations.
- Explore alternative or improved speech recognition models for better transcription accuracy.
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure robustness.
- Optimize performance for large datasets and concurrent users.

## Unmet Mandatory Requirements

- Full user interface implementation is pending (Milestone 5).
- Comprehensive integration and end-to-end testing remain to be completed (Milestone 6).
- Final documentation updates and repository management are outstanding (Milestones 7 and 8).

This document will be updated as the project progresses.
